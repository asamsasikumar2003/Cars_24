## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict car prices on the CARS24 platform by examining features such as:
- **Brand and Model**
- **Manufacturing Year**
- **Distance Traveled (Mileage)**
- **Location**
- **EMI Per Month**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Ownership Status**

## Team Members

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains information scraped from the CARS24 website and includes 500 records with the following columns:
- **Brand** - Car manufacturer
- **Model** - Car model
- **Year** - Manufacturing year
- **Distance Traveled** - Mileage of the car
- **Location** - Car's location
- **EMI** - Estimated EMI per month
- **Fuel Type** - Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
- **Ownership** - Number of previous owners
- **Price** - Price of the car

## Data Collection
Data was scraped from [CARS24](https://www.cars24.com/) using:
- **Requests Library** - To retrieve HTML content.
- **BeautifulSoup** - For parsing and navigating the HTML structure.

### Why BeautifulSoup?
- **Ease of Use:** Simple API for common scraping tasks.
- **Robust Parsing:** Handles broken and malformed HTML.
- **Powerful Search Capabilities:** Easily locate elements by tag, class, ID, or attributes.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values in columns like `Owner` and `Location`. Converted non-numeric columns (`Price`, `Distance`, `EMI`) to numerical formats.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Encoded categorical features to prepare data for analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled outliers in price and mileage columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Univariate Analysis
- **Top Car Brands**: Maruti, Hyundai, Honda, Tata, and Ford.
- **Price Range**: Majority of cars are priced below 7.5 lakhs.
- **Popular Models**: Baleno, Nexon, Swift, City, Ecosport.
- **Mileage Range**: 20,000 km to 80,000 km.

### Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
- **Brand vs Price**: Mahindra has a wide price range; MG brand has the highest starting prices.
- **Fuel Type vs Price**: Petrol cars have the widest price range; diesel and CNG follow.
- **Ownership vs Price**: First-owner cars generally command higher prices.

## Insights and Recommendations
1. **Popular Brands**: Maruti and Hyundai have strong resale values, reflecting brand loyalty.
2. **Preferred Models and Years**: Newer models (2022, 2019, 2017) retain value well.
3. **Fuel Type**: Petrol cars are most commonly available, especially for resale.
4. **Buying Advice**: Target first-owner, petrol-fueled cars within the mileage range of 20,000 to 80,000 km for better value.

## Usage
1. **Web Scraping**: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to scrape data from the CARS24 website.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Follow data cleaning and transformation steps outlined in the notebook.
3. **Analysis and Visualization**: Perform EDA to uncover insights using the notebookâ€™s analysis functions.

## Conclusion
This project reveals key insights into the used car market on CARS24, helping buyers make data-driven choices. Maruti and Hyundai cars are highly popular, with certain newer models holding value well in the resale market. First-owner, petrol-powered cars tend to offer the best value within the price range.
