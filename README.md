# Cars_24
## web scrapping and EDA using Python
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict car prices based on various features like brand, model, manufacturing year, distance traveled, location, fuel type, ownership status, and monthly EMI. The aim is to identify key factors that influence car pricing and build a predictive model that can estimate car prices accurately.
# Primary Objective:
- Analyze car prices based on features like brand, model, year, distance traveled, location, fuel type, ownership status, and EMI per month.
- Identify key factors that influence car prices, including brand, age of the car, fuel type, and other variables.
- Build a predictive model to estimate car prices accurately using machine learning algorithms.
- Perform data preprocessing by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore relationships between car price and other features.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis results to optimize car pricing strategies.
